<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher (for local documentation development)
  - ShopLocal API credentials
  - Basic understanding of REST APIs
</Info>

Follow these steps to set up your development environment for ShopLocal integrations.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your API credentials">

Log in to your ShopLocal business dashboard and navigate to Settings > Developer > API Keys to generate your API credentials.

You'll receive:
- API Key
- API Secret
- Webhook signing key (for webhook integrations)

</Step>

<Step title="Set up your development environment">

Install the ShopLocal SDK for your preferred language:

```bash npm
npm install @shoplocal/sdk
```

```bash python
pip install shoplocal-sdk
```

```bash ruby
gem install shoplocal-sdk
```

</Step>

<Step title="Test your integration">

Use our sandbox environment to test your integration before going live:

```javascript
import ShopLocal from '@shoplocal/sdk';

const client = new ShopLocal({
  apiKey: 'your_sandbox_api_key',
  environment: 'sandbox'
});

// Test API connection
const business = await client.businesses.get('your_business_id');
console.log(business);
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## API environments

ShopLocal provides two environments for development:

### Sandbox environment
Perfect for testing and development. Use sandbox API keys to:
- Test business creation and updates
- Simulate customer interactions
- Test webhook deliveries
- No real data or charges

```javascript
const client = new ShopLocal({
  apiKey: process.env.SHOPLOCAL_SANDBOX_KEY,
  environment: 'sandbox'
});
```

### Production environment
For live integrations with real customer data:

```javascript
const client = new ShopLocal({
  apiKey: process.env.SHOPLOCAL_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production'
});
```

<Warning>
Always use environment variables for API keys. Never commit keys to version control.
</Warning>

## Rate limits

The ShopLocal API implements rate limiting to ensure service quality:

- **Sandbox**: 100 requests per minute
- **Production**: 1,000 requests per minute per API key
- **Burst**: Up to 50 requests per second

Monitor rate limit headers in API responses:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640000000
```

## Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about events:

```javascript
// Configure webhook endpoint
app.post('/webhooks/shoplocal', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-shoplocal-signature'];
  const payload = req.body;
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  if (!ShopLocal.webhooks.verify(payload, signature)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Handle event
  switch (payload.event) {
    case 'business.updated':
      // Handle business update
      break;
    case 'review.created':
      // Handle new review
      break;
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
    Always implement proper error handling:
    ```javascript
    try {
      const business = await client.businesses.get(id);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 404) {
        // Business not found
      } else if (error.status === 429) {
        // Rate limit exceeded
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache responses when appropriate">
    Reduce API calls by caching data that doesn't change frequently:
    - Business hours
    - Location information
    - Category data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use webhook events">
    Instead of polling the API, use webhooks to get real-time updates about:
    - New reviews
    - Business information changes
    - Customer inquiries
  </Accordion>
